# Spring Security by Default in a Spring Boot API 

### Description
In this spring boot application, we discover the principles of the "security by default" philosophy that Spring Security brings to the table and how these fundamentals provide a robust layer of protection for your application from day one.
We also note how Spring Security requires authentication for every endpoint by default, requires CSRF for side effect operations, regenerates the user's default password on startup, writes secure headers in responses, and blocks many types of malicious requests.
